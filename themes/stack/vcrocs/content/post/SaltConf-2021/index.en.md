**SaltConf 2021 | SaltStack Config Session**

<!--more-->

---

I will be doing a SaltConf presentation for the first time at SaltConf 2021. I attended SaltConf 2020 for the first time after VMware purchased SaltStack Config.  This past year I have spent a lot of time reviewing SaltStack Config as a Windows Server Admin and I am excited to share what I have learned, to hopefully help some Windows Server Admins get started.  

I wanted to learn one of the configuration Management products for a couple of years and after VMware purchased SaltStack Config, the decision became obvious to me which one I should learn since I live in VMware vRealize Products all day, every day.

So register today for SaltConf 2021 and attend my session.
