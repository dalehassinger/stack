**How to Create a URL for Filtering Log Results and Share It with Others.**

<!--more-->

>I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work. – Thomas Edison

<small>**Note: VCF Operations for Logs 8.18.0 was used to create this Blog**</small>

In my previous blog, I focused on how to send log events to the **VCF Operations for Logs API**. [Click here to read...](https://www.vcrocs.info/vcf-operations-for-logs-syslog-api/) In this blog, I’ll demonstrate how to **generate a URL** that connects to VCF Operations for Logs and automatically applies a **filter** based on the log events you’ve just sent.

When running an automation script, as shown in the example below, I want the results to be saved in **VCF Operations for Logs**. To make it easier for the person running the script to view the logged events, I’ve incorporated the generation of the VCF Operations for Logs URL directly into the automation script. When reviewing the VCF Operations for Logs URL format, I found that it wasn’t very human-readable.

Example URL to filter events for VCF Operations for Logs:

```URL

To simplify the generation of the VCF Operations for Logs URL that includes a filter, I created a function that accepts parameters for the required filter items. In my example, I’m embedding the generated URL in an email, making it easy to click and have VCF Operations for Logs open  directly to your filtered data. I love Automation!

## Example Code:  

(3) Functions:  
* Function to Send event logs to VCF Operations for Logs API  
* Function to generate the VCF Operations for Logs URL  
* Function to send the email with the link in the email body  

  
```PowerShell

# Function to send event data to Aria Operations for Logs

function Send-ApiEvent {
  Param (
      # Parameters with default values, can be overridden as needed.

      [string]$priority         = 'info',                    # Event priority (info, warning, error, etc.)
      [string]$facility         = 'user',                    # Source generating the event (user, system, etc.)
      [string]$appname          = 'VCF_Automation',          # Application name logging the event
      [string]$hostname         = 'NA',                      # Hostname of the system (optional)

      [string]$Text             = "Custom Script execution"  # Custom text describing the event
  ) # End Param

  # Define headers for the REST API call, using JSON for content type and response format.
  $headers = @{

Automation Script Example:  
* Shows how to use the (3) Functions in the example code above   

  
```PowerShell

# Load the Create Events, Create URL and Send Email functions script, which will be used for logging events via Aria Operations for Logs API.
. /Path-to-Script/aria-operations-for-logs-syslog-api.ps1

# Define the VM name and the script process description
$vmName = "vCROCS-W2K22-06"
$scriptProcess = "VM Build: " + $vmName

# --- Connect to vCenter ---

# Define the parameters for connecting to the vCenter Server
$ConnectVIServerParams = @{
    Server   = '192.168.6.100'              # vCenter Server IP or FQDN
    User     = 'administrator@vcrocs.local' # vCenter Admin Username
    Password = 'VMware1!'                   # vCenter Admin Password
    Protocol = 'https'                      # Secure Protocol
    Force    = $true                        # Force connection even if already connected
}

# Log the connection attempt to Aria Operations for Logs
$text = $scriptProcess + " - Connecting to vCenter Server: " + $ConnectVIServerParams.Server
Send-ApiEvent -text $text -vmw_vcenter $ConnectVIServerParams.Server -vmw_esxi_vm_name $vmName

# Establish the connection to vCenter
$vCenterConnect = Connect-VIServer @ConnectVIServerParams

# Log successful connection status to Aria Operations for Logs
$text = $scriptProcess + " - Connection to vCenter Server: " + $ConnectVIServerParams.Server + " Successful: " + $vCenterConnect.IsConnected
Send-ApiEvent -text $text -vmw_vcenter $ConnectVIServerParams.Server -vmw_esxi_vm_name $vmName

# --- Add Your VM Build Steps Here ---
# Insert your VM build process code below. This section is a placeholder for any actions you will take on the VM during the build.

# Example Log Event - Add specific operations during VM build (e.g., software installation, configuration, etc.)
$text = $scriptProcess + " - Installing VCF Operations for Logs Agent"
Send-ApiEvent -text $text -vmw_vcenter $ConnectVIServerParams.Server -vmw_esxi_vm_name $vmName

# --- Disconnect from vCenter ---

# Log the disconnection attempt from vCenter
$text = $scriptProcess + " - Disconnecting from vCenter Server"
Send-ApiEvent -text $text -vmw_vcenter $ConnectVIServerParams.Server -vmw_esxi_vm_name $vmName

# Disconnect from the vCenter Server without confirmation prompts

# Call Function to build Filter URL

## Lessons Learned:

* VCF Operations for Logs is an excellent syslog solution, offering intuitive and user-friendly filtering tools.
* Always format events in a way that simplifies the creation of filters.
* Generating the VCF Operations Log URL link makes filtering and viewing events very easy.

In my blogs, I often emphasize that there are multiple methods to achieve the same objective. This article presents just one of the many ways you can tackle this task. I've shared what I believe to be an effective approach for this particular use case, but keep in mind that every organization and environment varies. There's no definitive right or wrong way to accomplish the tasks discussed in this article.

Always test new setups and processes, like those discussed in this blog, in a lab environment before implementing them in a production environment.
