<small>**Note: VCF Operations and Operations for Logs 8.18.0 was used to create this Blog**</small>

I’ve always felt that **VCF Operations for Logs** deserves more attention, it is a great product. With the Diagnostics Feature <small>(Skyline Replacement)</small> now included in VCF Operations, having VCF Operations for Logs installed <small>(Requirement for Operations Diagnostics Feature)</small> and configured for integration is a **game changer**. It excites me because now, many of the customers I work with will have access to VCF Operations for Logs in their environment, going beyond just collecting vCenter and ESXi Host logs.  

When developing **Automation Scripts** and processes, I always prioritize execution logging. In the past, I relied on generating text-based log files. However, my latest approach is to route all script logging data directly to VCF Operations for Logs. Once you learn to format the log data in a way that makes it easily searchable, you’ll find yourself wanting to use VCF Operations for Logs for all your logging needs. It transforms log management into an **efficient and streamlined** process that enhances script visibility and performance monitoring.

In this blog, I’ll share some sample script files demonstrating how to send logging information to Log Insight. Sending log data to VCF Operations for Logs via the API is straightforward and requires minimal code. One of the key advantages is that no authentication is needed to send log data, which not only simplifies the scripts but also improves execution speed.  

I’ve also included some sample filter queries that can be used within VCF Operations for Logs. If you’ve read my other blog posts, you’ll know I’m a big fan of creating custom VCF Operations **Dashboards** to present data in a **user-friendly** format. My goal is to ensure the data is formatted for quick visibility, allowing you to immediately spot issues that require attention. In this post, I’ll demonstrate how to use the Logs Widget within custom VCF Operations Dashboards to enhance your monitoring and troubleshooting experience.

## Example Code:  

Code details to make filter queries easier and exact:  
* The parameters in the code are the fields used in VCF Operations for Logs event  
* You will use these fields to filter events  
* Fields in my example code  
  * Uri              = # API Endpoint to send the event data  
  * priority         = # Event priority (info, warning, error, etc.)  
  * facility         = # Source generating the event (user, system, etc.)  
  * appname          = # Application name logging the event  
  * hostname         = # Hostname of the system (optional)  
  * vmw_esxi_vm_name = # Name of the VM or ESXi host (optional)  
  * vmw_vcenter      = # Name of the vCenter (optional)  
  * vmw_cluster      = # Name of the vCenter cluster (optional)  
  * vmw_host         = # Name of the vCenter Host (optional)  
  * Text             = # Custom text describing the event  
* Think about how to filter when creating the log events. Don't just add events without making sure a filter can find the precise results.

## RFC 3164 Code Example:

I often say there are many ways to achieve the same outcome. While researching for this blog, I came across examples of sending syslog data to VCF Operations for Logs using the RFC 3164 standard. I created a script, tested it in my lab, and it works well. Personally, I prefer using the VCF Operations for Logs API, but I recognize that others may have a use case for this approach. I’m sharing it here in hopes that it might be helpful to someone.  

  
```PowerShell
 
function Send-SyslogMessage {
    Param (
        [string]$IP             = "192.168.6.94",        # Default Syslog server IP
        [int]$Port              = 514,                   # Default Syslog server UDP port
        [string]$Facility       = "syslog",              # Default Syslog facility
        [string]$Severity       = "info",                # Default Syslog severity
        [string]$Content        = "No Content provided", # Default Message content
        [string]$SourceHostname = "VCF-Automation",      # Default Hostname
        [string]$Tag            = "PS-Script"            # Default Tag for the message
    )

    # Map RFC 3164 facilities to numeric values
    $facilityMap = @{
        kern      = 0; user      = 1; mail      = 2;  daemon   = 3; 
        auth      = 4; syslog    = 5; lpr       = 6;  news     = 7;
        uucp      = 8; cron      = 9; authpriv  = 10; ftp      = 11;
        ntp       = 12; audit    = 13; alert    = 14; clock    = 15;
        local0    = 16; local1   = 17; local2   = 18; local3   = 19;
        local4    = 20; local5   = 21; local6   = 22; local7   = 23;
    }

    # Map RFC 3164 severities to numeric values
    $severityMap = @{
        emerg     = 0; alert     = 1; crit      = 2; err       = 3;
        warn      = 4; notice    = 5; info      = 6; debug     = 7;
    }

    # Resolve facility and severity values
    $facilityValue = $facilityMap[$Facility.ToLower()]
    $severityValue = $severityMap[$Severity.ToLower()]

    if (-not $facilityValue) { $facilityValue = $facilityMap["syslog"] }  # Default to syslog
    if (-not $severityValue) { $severityValue = $severityMap["info"] }    # Default to informational

    # Calculate the syslog priority value
    $pri = "<" + (($facilityValue * 8) + $severityValue) + ">"

    # Timestamp in RFC 3164 format
    $timestamp = (Get-Date).ToString("MMM dd HH:mm:ss")

    # Create the syslog message
    $header = "$timestamp $SourceHostname "
    $msg = $pri + $header + $Tag + ": " + $Content

    # Display the message to be sent
    # Write-Host "Sending syslog message: $msg"

    # Convert message to ASCII bytes
    $byteArray = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes($msg)

    # Send the message via UDP
    $udpClient = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient
    $udpClient.Connect($IP, $Port)
    $udpClient.Send($byteArray, $byteArray.Length) | Out-Null
    $udpClient.Close()

    $output = "Syslog message sent to " + $IP + ":" + $Port
    Write-Host $output
}

# Example usage of the function
Send-SyslogMessage -Content "Creating PS Script for Syslog"
 
```

In my blogs, I often emphasize that there are multiple methods to achieve the same objective. This article presents just one of the many ways you can tackle this task. I've shared what I believe to be an effective approach for this particular use case, but keep in mind that every organization and environment varies. There's no definitive right or wrong way to accomplish the tasks discussed in this article.

---

Always test new setups and processes, like those discussed in this blog, in a lab environment before implementing them in a production environment.
