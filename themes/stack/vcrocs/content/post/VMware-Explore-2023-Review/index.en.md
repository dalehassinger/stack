**VMware Expore 2023 was the best Conference that I ever attended!**

<!--more-->

---

You may be wondering why the headline says "VMware Explore 2023 was the best Conference that I ever attended!". Here are my reasons.  

* I got to meet some of my co-workers in person and shake their hand and thank them personally for all their help and support. So many people helped me get to where I am in my career and it was good for me to personally thank them.  

* I was the Team Captain of a Hackathon Team that won 2nd place. The Hackathon Team was a great group of people that I will now call my friends for the rest of my life. During the Hackathon I did 1:1 presentations to Alan Renouf, Chris Wolf and other great Hackathon Judges. While doing the 1:1 to Alan, William Lam was also at my table to discuss the Teams project.
  * **Hackathon Team**:  
    * Tina Krogull  
    * Wes Milliron  
    * Viviana Miranda  
    * Madison Welsch  
    * Edgar Sanchez  
    * Dale Hassinger  

* I did my first live presentation in the VMware {code} Theater. The session was full with friends, co-workers, customers and other conference attendees. The feedback after my presentation was great with many people wanting more information and follow-ups. The topic was of interest to a lot of people.  

* There were many sessions with new VMware product announcements that are very exciting. Go view the recorded session videos on the [VMware Explore Web Site](https://www.vmware.com/explore/video-library/search.html#year=2023).  

* Attending VMware Explore as an employee for the first time was a much different experience than when I was customer. I had a feeling of pride for being part of such a great company and culture.
