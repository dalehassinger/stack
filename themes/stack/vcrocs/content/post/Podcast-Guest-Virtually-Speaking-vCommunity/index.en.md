## **Behind the Mic: Talking about the Hackathon on the Virtually Speaking Podcast**

When my team took first place at the VMware Explore 2025 Hackathon, the excitement online was instant. Social feeds lit up with highlights from the event and congratulations from across the vCommunity.

Within a day, I heard from Pete — he invited me to join the Virtually Speaking Podcast to share what our team built and talk about the Hackathon, and what makes the VMware Explore Hackathon such a great experience.

There was no hesitation on my end. I jumped at the chance to join the conversation. The recording turned out to be a laid-back and fun discussion about collaboration, creativity, and the results that come from late-night coding sessions. Pete and John were exactly as sharp and funny off-air as they are on every episode.

## **Final Thoughts:**

- I take every opportunity to share ideas and knowledge with the VMware vCommunity.
- Being invited as a guest on a podcast I’ve listened to for years was a great chance to connect with even more members of the VMware community.
