## VMware Aria Automation 8.12 Released:

With the release of VMware Aria Automation 8.12, Custom Form Versioning was added to the Product.

If you never did versioning before, this Blog Post should save you some time getting started and help you understand how the new features was designed to work.

## How to start with previous custom form

This screen shot is a very important step to start with previous version of Custom Form. Use **"New Form From"** and select previous version. You will then have all the custom changes you made in previous version as a starting point for new version.
