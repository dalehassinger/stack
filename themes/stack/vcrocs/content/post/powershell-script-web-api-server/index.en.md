**How to use PowerShell Scripts as a Web Server or RESTful API Front End Server...**

<!--more-->

---

>I’m constantly discovering new things, even after years of working with PowerShell. This blog post highlights a feature I only recently came across, and I’m excited to share it with you. My goal is to spark some ideas and inspire new use cases in your own automation journey.

---

## Use Case:  

Here’s a PowerShell use case I hadn’t come across until just last week: using a PowerShell script as a web server—no separate web server installation needed. Just run the script, and your machine starts listening for connections on the port you specify. This idea immediately got my wheels turning about all the possibilities this unlocks. You’ll find some example scripts included in this blog.

After getting a basic listener running on port 8080 with a non-SSL connection, I was curious how complex it would be to switch to port 443 with SSL. A bit of research showed it doesn’t take much—just a few changes to the script. Examples of that are also included here.

Once I saw how simple it was to handle incoming web requests, I naturally started thinking: what if a PowerShell script could act as an API front end? I tweaked the listener script to respond to RESTful API requests—and just like that, PowerShell was replying with data to API calls. Not every system you need to pull data from has a REST API, but with this technique, you can make your own. That’s a game-changer for my automation.

## PowerShell Script for RESTful API Requests Use Case:  
One example is the VCF Operations Management Pack (MP) Builder, which needs to make REST API calls. With this setup, a PowerShell script can serve that role directly. If you can script it, you can expose it as an API and include the data within VCF Operations!  

In my automation journey, I’ve yet to find something I couldn’t automate with PowerShell. Adding modules to your scripts unlocks even more use cases—like connecting to remote systems over SSH and parsing the results. Having a PowerShell script act as a RESTful API front end opens up endless possibilities for automation and integration.

## Code Examples:

This example is a simple **Web Server** (non-ssl) that displays text along with the current date and time, which updates on every page load or refresh.  

* Script can be used to show any web page and data you can create. Think about some cool use cases.  
* The image demonstrates how the time updates on each page refresh, highlighting that the web page is dynamic.

This example is a simple **RESTful API front end** that returns any data that you have in the PS script.  

(4) Sample API calls:  
* Returns Status  
* Returns a simple Hello  
* Returns all the VM Names in my lab vCenter  
* Returns Tiered Memory usage of VMs in my Lab  
* Script can be used to return any data you can create. Think about some cool use cases.

* YAML file contents to use with the PowerShell Script  
* I've been using a YAML file with all my current scripts to store values for connecting to vCenter, VCF Operations, VCF Automation, and more. If anything changes, I just update the YAML file, and all the scripts continue to work without any issues.



```yaml
# vCenter Connection
vCenter:
  server: vcsa8x.vcrocs.local
  username: administrator@vcrocs.local
  password: VMware1!
  ignoreCertErrors: true

# A Single ESXi Host Connection
Host101:
  server: 192.168.6.101
  username: root
  password: VMware1!

# VCF Operations
OPS:
  opsURL: https://vao.vcrocs.local
  opsUsername: admin
  opsPassword: VMware1!
  authSource:  local

# VCF Automation
Automation:
  autoURL: vaa.vcrocs.local
  autoUsername: configadmin
  autoPassword: VMware1!
  autoDomain:  System Domain

**Here is a sample PowerShell Script web page that is used with the Text Display Widget within a VCF Operations Dashboard.**  
* The PowerShell Script is running as a service within a Linux VM  
* There is a 2nd PS script that runs and collects the Tiered Memory Metrics every five minutes and saves the data as a json file that is used with the web page  
* 100s of use cases

I have been using Rocky Linux more in my lab for testing PowerShell Automation scripts.

Here is how I install PowerShell on Rocky Linux:  



```Bash

# Install PowerShell
sudo dnf install https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.5.0/powershell-7.5.0-1.rh.x86_64.rpm

# Turn off Firewall in your lab to make testing easier
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
sudo systemctl disable firewalld

# Install sshpass to use with PS scripts where you want to make a SSH connection
sudo dnf install epel-release
sudo dnf install sshpass
sshpass -V

```

---

**How to setup a PowerShell Script to run as a service with Rocky Linux:**



```Bash

# Create a new service file (e.g., myscript.service) under /etc/systemd/system/:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/vcrocs-api.service

# Then add the following content:

[Unit]
Description=PowerShell API Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/pwsh -File /root/http-server-api-test-8080.ps1
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


# After saving the file, reload systemd to recognize the new service:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Then enable the service so it starts on boot:
sudo systemctl enable vcrocs-api.service

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start vcrocs-api.service

# Service Status
sudo systemctl status vcrocs-api.service

# Stop the Service
sudo systemctl stop vcrocs-api.service

```

**Use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to create, edit, and run PowerShell scripts on your remote Linux-based PowerShell servers:**  

* Try using the VS Code Remote-SSH extension with a Linux server — it’s a setup I really enjoy. Your code is saved and executed directly on the remote Linux machine.

**Steps to create a Self Signed SSL Certifcate to test with:**



```Bash
# Using openssl
openssl genrsa -out vcrocs.key 2048

openssl req -new -key vcrocs.key -out vcrocs.csr

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in vcrocs.csr -signkey vcrocs.key -out vcrocs.crt

openssl pkcs12 -export -out vcrocs.pfx -inkey vcrocs.key -in vcrocs.crt

**If you’re primarily a Windows user and hesitant about using Linux, here’s a quick tip: try installing Cockpit — it provides a user-friendly GUI to help manage your Linux VM with ease.**

* Here’s some IT career advice: Get comfortable working with both Windows and Linux. Both operating systems play key roles in enterprise environments.
  * If you’re a Linux user, don’t shy away from using PowerShell. With VMware PowerCLI, automation becomes much easier and more powerful.

Steps to install Cockpit on Rocky Liunux:  



```Bash

# Update the server
sudo dnf update -y

# install Cockpit
sudo dnf install cockpit -y

sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket

# FW changes
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=cockpit
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Allow root to use Cockpit
sudo nano /etc/cockpit/disallowed-users
# Remove root

## Lessons learned:

* A PowerShell Script can be a Web Server or a RESTful API front end  
* Great way to test web pages in a lab or simple web server
* The above scripts are cross platform. Can run on Windows, Mac or Linux  
* I like that I can take a bare bones Linux VM, install PowerShell, add the script and I have web pages available or a RESTful API front end

In my blogs, I often emphasize that there are multiple methods to achieve the same objective. This article presents just one of the many ways you can tackle this task. I've shared what I believe to be an effective approach for this particular use case, but keep in mind that every organization and environment varies. There's no definitive right or wrong way to accomplish the tasks discussed in this article.

---

Always test new setups and processes, like those discussed in this blog, in a lab environment before implementing them in a production environment.
