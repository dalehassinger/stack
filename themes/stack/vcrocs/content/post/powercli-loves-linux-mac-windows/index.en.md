**Home Lab Automation!**

>The real power of innovation comes not from the tools we use, but from the mindset we bring. Think outside the box, and any type of computer can become the key to endless possibilities.

## Let's get Started:

**Ready to dive into automation? Excellent choice!**  

**Planning to automate on a Mac, Linux, or Windows? Fantastic!**  

I love that **VMware PowerCLI** is built as a PowerShell module, making automation seamless across Mac, Linux, and Windows. Since VMware is my primary focus for automation, PowerShell is my go-to tool—thanks to PowerCLI. So far in my Automation journey, there hasn’t been a process I couldn’t automate with PowerShell.

For 2025, I’ve been invited to be a **VMware Community {code} Coach**! This year, my blogs will feature even more code examples to help others get started with automation, VMware solutions, and much more...

In my home lab, I needed a quick and easy way to power on and off my VMs. Some VMs I want to shut down every evening and start up again each morning—not just to save electricity, but also to give my MS-01s a bit of a break. In this blog, I’ll share the scripts I created to automate this process.

---

I have a VCF environment running in my lab on a nested ESXi host, <small>[(See my Blog to create an VCF in your lab with a script)](https://www.vcrocs.info/vcf-deploy-home-lab/)</small>. My goal is to log into the ESXi host, gracefully shut down all VCF VMs, then log into vCenter to shut down the nested ESXi host. To ensure a clean shutdown, I’ve added logic to verify that all VMs are powered off before proceeding to the next steps. In this blog, I’ll share the code I use to automate this process.

To automate tasks in my lab, I use a **Rocky Linux** VM with **PowerShell** installed. I’ve set up cron jobs to execute my PowerShell scripts on a schedule. Here are some details on how I configured these cron jobs to streamline automation.

A great resource for setting up cron jobs properly? **ChatGPT!** It’s a handy tool for troubleshooting and getting the syntax just right.

Proper format to run PowerShell Scripts with a cron job.

  

```Bash
# Power On VCF Lab @ 5:00 am everyday
0 5 * * * /usr/bin/pwsh /home/administrator/power-on.ps1 >> /home/administrator/power-on.log 2>&1

# Power Off VCF Lab @ 11:59 pm everyday
59 11 * * * /usr/bin/pwsh /home/administrator/power-off.ps1 >> /home/administrator/power-off.log 2>&1

# cron format for day/time
* * * * * command_to_run
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └── Day of the week (0-7, Sunday = 0 or 7)
│ │ │ └──── Month (1-12)
│ │ └────── Day of the month (1-31)
│ └──────── Hour (0-23)
└────────── Minute (0-59)
  
```  

  

```Bash
# edit cron jobs
crontab -e

# List cron jobs
crontab -l

# restart cron service
sudo systemctl restart crond
  
```  

## Examples of Cron Expressions

| Cron Expression | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| `0 0 * * *` | Runs at midnight every day |
| `0 12 * * 1-5` | Runs at noon (12:00 PM) Monday to Friday |
| `*/15 * * * *` | Runs every 15 minutes |
| `30 9 1 * *` | Runs at 9:30 AM on the 1st day of every month |
| `0 18 * * 5` | Runs at 6:00 PM every Friday |
| `0 3 * * 1,3,5` | Runs at 3:00 AM on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday |

## Lessons learned:

* Automating VM power on and off helps ensure consistency in your workflows.  
* All the scripts in this blog were created and tested on a Mac using PowerShell.
* In the lab, the scripts are scheduled and executed on a Rocky Linux VM with PowerShell installed.
* Don’t dismiss PowerShell just because it was created by Microsoft. Embrace it to enhance your automation journey!

I created a Google NotebookLM Podcast based on the content of this blog. While it may not be entirely accurate, is any podcast ever 100% perfect, even when real people are speaking? Take a moment to listen and share your thoughts with me!

In my blogs, I often emphasize that there are multiple methods to achieve the same objective. This article presents just one of the many ways you can tackle this task. I've shared what I believe to be an effective approach for this particular use case, but keep in mind that every organization and environment varies. There's no definitive right or wrong way to accomplish the tasks discussed in this article.

---

Always test new setups and processes, like those discussed in this blog, in a lab environment before implementing them in a production environment.
