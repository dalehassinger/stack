## Why Attend

**When I was a VMware Customer, I tried to go to VMware Explore every year. Here is a list of reasons why I enjoyed the conference:**

* To meet other people in the same field as myself. Exchange stories, ideas, contact information, etc.. The Community side of the event alone, is worth the cost to go.  
* To attend sessions that are done by people that you follow their blogs or socials, is an exciting experience.  
* The Key Note Sessions get you excited to see what is coming with the next releases of the VMware Products.  
* Vendor Parties are a great way to meet people and have good food and drink.
* Other Highlights for evening Parties for me:
  * vExpert Party
  * VMUG Party
  * Event Concert on the last night (Black Keys Concert was my favorite)  

---

**As a Employee my reasons are different to attend. Here is a list:**
* To meet people in person that I work with everyday. We are located across the country and don't get to meet in person. Even if we went into a office everyday, we would never get to meet.  
* Get Sessions accepted and share the knowledge with the products I work with every day. I like doing presentations on the Automation, Monitoring and Logging Products.  
* I like to participate in the Hackathon that is part of the conference. In 2023 my Team received 2nd place.

## Sessions

I submitted a couple sessions that hope get accepted in 2024, Fingers Crossed. One session I will be presenting with a customer, and 2 sessions I included TAMs to present with me. I am excited about the topics. When the sessions get announced, check back on this blog. I will update what was accepted.
