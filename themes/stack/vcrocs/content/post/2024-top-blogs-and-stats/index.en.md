#### **Surprising Insights from Blogging**  

I'm always surprised by which blog posts resonate the most with readers. Some of my top-performing posts started as simple notes to myself—a personal Wiki to document processes I didn’t want to forget.  

Ironically, those "just-for-me" posts often end up being the most popular. It turns out that if something was challenging enough for me to document, others are probably facing the same challenge and searching for answers too.  

So, if you're ever wondering what to write about, start with what you need to remember. Chances are, someone else will find it just as helpful!
